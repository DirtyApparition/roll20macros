// There is an example weapon macro below the generic one so you can see an example of what to fill in. You will also need to 
// look at the hit modifier on your personal character sheet to input the correct rolls on the dice section. You will be 
// adapting each section to your character except the "&{template:default}" which you will need to leave exactly the way it is.
// Each macro begins with "&{template:default}" and end with "}".

// (Example: my wizard's light crossbow has a modifier of +3 to hit. 
// So the dice is input as "1d20+3" (one 20-sided dice rolled and // add 3 to it). Damage is rolled separately and is "1d8+1" (one 8-sided dice and add 1 to it).
